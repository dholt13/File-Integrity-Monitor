Designed a custom File Integrity Monitor using PowerShell. I used SHA-512 hashing algorithm to create a integrity baseline for target files/folders. I programed the File Integrity Monitor to so continuous comparison of the baseline vs actual baseline and to raise any alerts if any deviations occurred. Also, I programmed the File Integrity Monitor to create log files to keep track of any alerts that were raised. I will add an feature that will send the log files to the users via email
