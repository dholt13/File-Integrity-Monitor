Designed a custom File Integrity Monitor using PowerShell. I used SHA-512 hashing algorithm to create a integrity baseline for target files/folders. I programmed the File Integrity Monitor to do continuous comparison of the baseline vs actual baseline and to raise any alerts if any deviations occurred.
